# LGGuitars

Very first website that I created, using my Dad's hand made guitars (in his shed!) as the content.
Also the first website that I hosted and bought a web domain for.
I am currently waiting for some audio files of each guitar to add to the site.

I learned alot from doing this project, it was my very first full website that I built from scratch, including designing the site and building it. I learned alot about CSS and especially media queries, trying to get it to look right on mobile was a challenge. 

Because I did this site a long time ago there are a few things I would have done differently, I will continue to work on this project and update it periodically.
## This project has now been updated to a React App
